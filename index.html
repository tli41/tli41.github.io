        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at Oxford College of Emory University. My research focuses on mobile crowd sensing (MCS), edge computing, privacy, indoor localization, and bike sharing. I got my Ph.D. from UNC Charlotte under supervision of <a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~yu/">Dr. Yu Wang</a> in 2019. </p>
        <p>Prior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from Xidian University, China in Jun. 2012. After that, I worked at a counsoler for 2 years, which simulated my passion to work with students. I enjoy teaching and spending time with students outside of class.</p>
